Digital Artist Needs Help/Advice

Hi,

I'm a digital artist looking to make paintings come alive with AR - the paintings will activate with AR and become animated.
I'm starting to learn Unreal Engine and Unity (any advice on which to focus on) I have student versions of Maya and Mudbox, and am using Corel Painter.  I'm stuggling to find the time to learn Mac's ARKit.

Would love any advice or help.

Cheers

Rod
